        It’s no secret—the more accessible your travel program information is, the more likely your
        travelers will use it. With Direct Travel, a branded, customized travel portal can be the
        hub of your entire program. Our travel portal options will provide your travelers with quick
        access to travel resources such as travel policies, customized messaging and announcements,
        documents and forms, training program links, and more. Or, if you prefer, we can brand your
        online booking tool to serve as your portal. We’re flexible and ready to provide what works
        best for your travelers depending on your culture and goals.
